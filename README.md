# Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing Italian PDFs, extracting text, and preparing data for GraphDB/Neo4j integration. Licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Ingestion (Data Layer)

- [**file_classifier.py**](./src/ingestion/file_classifier.py): Classifies PDFs as text-based or image-based using `pdfplumber` and saves the result as metadata for later usage.
- [**text_ingestor.py**](./src/ingestion/text_ingestor.py): Extracts text from files using `pdfplumber` (text-based), `Tesseract OCR` (image-based, `lang="ita"`), and `PyMuPDF` (images).
- [**text_cleaner.py**](./src/ingestion/text_cleaner.py): Cleans the extracted text.
- [**text_chunker.py**](./src/ingestion/text_chunker.py): Splits cleaned text into sentence-based chunks.

## üìù Logging

Proper code is embedded in each script and execution logs for each is saved to `logs/` for debugging.
